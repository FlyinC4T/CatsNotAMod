It does not do anything (trust me).

#
### Details & Instructions
- If it does anything you will need **Utilla 1.5.0+** ([Latest Version](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla/releases/latest)).
- Any feedback (Questions, Suggestions, etc.) can be answered on my project server. ([Discord](https://discord.gg/gXNM5KYmFj))

That's about it.
